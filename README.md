# MovieMax API

## Project Overview

The **MovieMax** project is a web application that provides users with access to information about various movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. This is the backend server-side component of the MovieMax application, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).
